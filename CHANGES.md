### Breaking changes

- The ``debug`` configuration option has been replaced with [loglevel](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#loglevel).

- In contrast to sessionStorage and localStorage, IndexedDB is an asynchronous database.
  A lot of code that relied on database access to be synchronous had to be
  updated to work with asynchronous access via promises.

- In order to add support for XEP-0156, the XMPP connection needs to be created
  only once we know the JID of the user that's logging in. This means that the
  [connectionInitialized](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/api/-_converse.html#event:connectionInitialized)
  event now fires much later than before. Plugins that rely on `connectionInitialized`
  being triggered before the user's JID has been provided will need to be updated.

- The following API methods now return promises:
  * `_converse.api.chats.get`
  * `_converse.api.chats.create`
  * `_converse.api.rooms.get`
  * `_converse.api.rooms.create`
  * `_converse.api.roomviews.close`

- Changes the events:
  * The `chatBoxInitialized` event now triggers when a `_converse.ChatBox` (not the view) is opened.
  * Renamed the old `chatBoxInitialized` to `chatBoxViewInitialized` and trigger only for `ChatBoxView` instances.
  * Renamed `chatRoomOpened` event to `chatRoomViewInitialized`
  * The order of certain events have now changed: `statusInitialized` is now triggered after `initialized` and `connected` and `reconnected`.

- `_converse.api.chats.get()` now only returns one-on-one chats, not the control box or headline notifications.
- The `show_only_online_users` setting has been removed.
- `_converse.api.alert.show` is now `_converse.api.show` and instead of taking
  an integer for the `type`, "info", "warn" or "error" should be passed in.
- The `converse-headline` plugin has been split up into `converse-headlines` and `converse-headlines-view`.

## 5.0.5 (2019-11-20)

- Prevent editing of sent file uploads.
- #1089: When filtering the roster for `online` users, show all non-offline users.
- #1733: New message notifications for a minimized chat stack on top of each other
- #1757: Chats are hidden behind the controlbox on mobile
- #1760: Private messages no longer received after websocket reconnect

## 5.0.4 (2019-10-08)

- New config option [allow_message_corrections](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#allow-message-corrections)
  which, if set to `last`, limits editing of sent messages to the last message sent.
- Bugfix: Don't treat every duplicate message ID as a message correction; since some clients don't use globally unique ID's this causes false positives.
- Bugfix: process stanzas from mam one-by-one in order to correctly process message receipts
- #1712: `TypeError: plugin._features is not a function`
- #1714: Don't notify the user in case we're receiving a message delivery receipt only
- #1739: New config option [assets_path](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#assets-path)
  which lets you set the path from which "chunks" are loaded.

## 5.0.3 (2019-09-13)

- Emit `chatBoxFocused` and `chatBoxBlurred` events for emoji picker input
- SECURITY FIX: Reject unencapsulated forwarded messages, since we don't support XEP-0297 on its own

## 5.0.2 (2019-09-11)

- `po` translations files are now loaded via Webpack. As a result the `locales_url`
  config option is now removed given that the path to the locale JSON files is now
  determined by the webpack config and can't be changed at runtime.
- The JSON representing emojis is now fetched asynchronously as a separate file `converse.emojis.js`.
- Webpack is now configured with a `publicPath` set to `/dist/`. This is necessary
  so that chunks (such as the emojis and locales JSON files) can be fetched asynchronously.
  This means that all your assets need to be served at `/dist`. If you need to set a
  different path, you'll need to set `publicPath` in `webpack.config.js` to
  your preferred path and then rebuild all assets (e.g. `make dist`).
- Use `listenTo` to avoid memory leaks when views get removed.
- SECURITY FIX: Ignore MAM `chat` messages not sent from yourself
- #1692 Bugfix: `TypeError: oldest_message is undefined`
- #1704: SECURITY FIX: Impersonation by misusage of groupchat carbons
- #1705: Bugfix: `this.roomspanel` is `undefined` after hibernating

## 5.0.1 (2019-08-14)

- Add a new GUI for moderator actions. You can trigger it by entering `/modtools` in a MUC.
- Reconnect if the server doesn't respond to a `ping` within 10 seconds.
- Don't query for MAM MUC messages before the cached messages have been restored (another cause of duplicate messages).
- Show an error message and option to retry when fetching of the MAM archive times out
- Bugfix: `TypeError: o.getAttribute is not a function converse-chatview.js` (can cause messages to not appear).
- #1679: Room invitation fails with singleton and random server assigned room name

## 5.0.0 (2019-08-08)

- BOSH support has been moved to a plugin.
- Support for XEP-0410 to check whether we're still present in a room
- Initial support for the [CredentialsContainer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CredentialsContainer) web API

  wait for all promises returned by the event's handlers to finish before continuing.
- Properly handle message correction being received before the corrected message
- Groupchat default configuration now supports `list-multi` fields
- Bugfix: Don't set `muc_domain` for roomspanel if `locked_muc_domain` is `true`.

- New config option [auto_focus](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#auto-focus)
- New config option [clear_messages_on_reconnection](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#clear-messages-on-reconnection)

- New config option [message_limit](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#message-limit)
- New config option [muc_fetch_members](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#muc-fetch-members)
- New config option [muc_mention_autocomplete_min_chars](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#muc-mention-autocomplete-min-chars)
- New config option [muc_show_join_leave_status](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#muc-show-join-leave-status)
- New config option [singleton](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#singleton)
  By setting this option to `false` and `view_mode` to `'embedded'`, it's now possible to
  "embed" the full app and not just a single chat. To embed just a single chat, it's now
  necessary to explicitly set `singleton` to `true`.
- Re-add the previously removed config option [keepalive](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#keepalive)
- New event: [chatBoxBlurred](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/api/-_converse.html#event:chatBoxBlurred)

- Rename `muc_disable_moderator_commands` to [muc_disable_slash_commands](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#muc-disable-slash-commands).

- Remove the `expose_rid_and_sid` configuration setting.
- A `prebind_url` is now mandatory when setting `authentication` to `prebind`.
  It's no longer possible to pass in `rid` and `sid` values to `converse.initialize.
- Removed events `statusChanged` and `statusMessageChanged`. Instead, you can
  listen on the `change:status` or `change:status\_message` events on
  `_converse.xmppstatus`.
- #1403: Rename show_chatstate_notifications to show_chat_state_notifications

### API changes

- `_converse.chats.open` and `_converse.rooms.open` now take a `force`
  parameter to force maximizing (in `overlayed` view mode) or bringing a
  background chat into the foreground (in `fullscreen` view mode). Previously
  this was the default behavior.
- `_converse.api.emit` has been removed in favor of [\_converse.api.trigger](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/api/-_converse.api.html#.trigger)

## 4.2.0 (2019-04-04)

**Note:** This release introduces a hard requirement on [MAM:2](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html),
specifically the requirement that the MAM archive ID matches the [XEP-0359 stanza-id](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0359.html).
Patches intended to make Converse work with MAM:1 will cause problems and
unexpected behaviour due to the above requirement, which is not met with MAM:1.
This will affect OpenFire users who use the [monitoring plugin](https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugin-archive.jsp?plugin=monitoring)
version 1.7.0 and below. You're advised to stay on Converse version 4.1.2 until an update to that plugin has been released.

- New API method `_converse.api.vcard.update`.
- The `contactStatusChanged` event has been renamed to `contactPresenceChanged`
  and a event `presenceChanged` is now also triggered on the contact.

  `Presence` which resolves with the `Backbone.Model` representing the chat
  object.

- #956 Conversation pane should show my own identity in pane header
- The UI is now based on Bootstrap4 and Flexbox is used extensively.
- Fontawesome 5 is used for icons.
- User Avatars are now shown in chat messages.

## Configuration changes

- Removed the `storage` configuration setting, use [trusted](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#trusted) instead.
- Removed the `use_vcards` configuration setting, instead VCards are always used.
- Removed the `xhr_custom_status` and `xhr_custom_status_url` configuration
  settings. If you relied on these settings, you can instead listen for the
  [statusMessageChanged](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/events.html#contactstatusmessagechanged)
  event and make the XMLHttpRequest yourself.
- Removed  `xhr_user_search` in favor of only accepting `xhr_user_search_url` as configuration option.
- `xhr_user_search_url` has to include the `?` character now in favor of more flexibility. See example in the documentation.

  `jid` instead of just an `id`.
- New configuration settings [nickname](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#nickname)
  and [auto_join_private_chats](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#auto-join-private-chats).

## Architectural changes

- Extracted the views from `converse-muc.js` into `converse-muc-views.js` and
  where appropriate moved methods from the views into the models/collections.
  This makes MUC possible in headless mode.
- Created a new core plugin `converse-roster.js` which contains the models for
  roster-related data. Previously this code was in `converse-core.js`.
- VCards are now stored separately from chats and roster contacts.

## Other

- Support for OTR (off-the-record) encryption has been dropped.

## 3.3.4 (2018-03-05)

- Don't show bookmark toggles when PEP bookmarking not supported by the XMPP server.
- Emojis are now sent in unicode instead of short names (also in MUCs)

### Bugfixes

- Server field in `Rooms` tab showed MUC supporting clients instead of only components.

### Translation changes

## 3.3.3 (2018-02-14)

### Bugfixes
- Attribute error when empty IQ stanza is returned for vCard query
- In fullscreen view, sometimes a background MUC would come into the foreground
  when a new message appears inside it.

### Security fixes

- CVE-2018-6591: Don't allow PEP bookmarks if `pubsub#publish-options` is not advertised by the server.

    In previous versions of converse.js, bookmarks sent to servers that don't
    support `pubsub#publish-options` were visible to all your contacts, even
    though they should be kept private. This is due to those servers simply
    ignoring the `pubsub#publish-options` directive and converse.js not checking
    first whether `pubsub#publish-options` is supported before setting bookmarks
    via PEP.

    More info here: https://gultsch.de/converse_bookmarks.html

### New features
- XEP-0382 Spoiler Messages (currently only for private chats)
- Listen for new room bookmarks pushed from the user's PEP service.
- Simplified the [embedded](https://conversejs.org/demo/embedded.html) usecase.
    - No need to manually blacklist or whitelist any plugins.
    - Relies on the [view_mode](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#view-mode) being set to `'embedded'`.
    - The main `converse.js` build can be used for the embedded usecase.
    - Maintain MUC session upon page reload

### API changes
- New API method `_converse.api.disco.getIdentity` to check whether a JID has a given identity.

### Configuration settings

- New configuration setting [allow_public_bookmarks](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#allow-public-bookmarks)
- New configuration setting [root](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#root)
- The [view_mode](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#view-mode) setting now has a new possible value: `embedded`

### Translation updates
- Chinese (Traditional), French, German, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Ukrainian

## 3.3.2 (2018-01-29)

- Could not register on Ejabberd 18. `"Missing attribute 'id' in tag qualified by namespace 'jabber:client'"`
- #878 Ending slash in link not recognized
- #921 FATAL error when `visible_toolbar_buttons.emoji = false`

- #993 `moment.format` is not a function error when sending a message.
- #994 TypeError when using the `user.login` API.

- #1003 Handle bare MUC room JIDs

### Translation changes

## 3.3.1 (2018-01-18)

### UI/UX changes
- Add new configuration option
  [show_message_load_animation](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#show-message-load-animation)
  with a default value of `false`. The message load animations (added in 3.3.0)
  cause slowness and performance issues in Firefox, so they're now disabled by default.

### Translation changes
- Updated Spanish and French translations.
- New translation: "Simplified Chinese"
- Rename `zh` language code to `zh_TW` and add Simplified Chinese as `zh_CN`

## 3.3.0 (2018-01-17)

### Bugfixes
- #800 Could not register successfully in ejabberd 17.01
- #949 Don't flash the roster contacts filter (i.e. hide by default)
- #951 Duplicate messages received in an MUC chat room.
- #953 MUC "Features" displayed when exiting configuration
- #967 Rooms list doesn't show when the server doesn't support bookmarks
- Don't require `auto_login` to be `true` when using the API to log in.
- Moment locale wasn't being set to the value passed via the `i18n` option.
- In the chat heading, two avatars sometimes get rendered.
- Refetch the roster from the server after reconnection.
  From the perspective of the XMPP server, this is an entirely new login,
  and therefore as per [RFC-6121](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6121#section-2.1.6)
  the roster SHOULD be queried, making the client an "interested resource".
  Otherwise connected contacts might not get your presence updates.
- The way the archive ID of a MAM message is specified, has changed.
  See https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html#archives_id
- Fixed error building DOM toggle_chats.html span.unread-message-count class attribute
- Bugfix. In a MUC the `/help` command didn't render properly.
- The `/voice` MUC command didn't set the right role in order to grant voice again.

### New Features
- Emojis are now sent in unicode instead of short names
- #314 Add support for opening chat rooms with a URL fragment such as `#converse/room?jid=room@domain`
  and private chats with a URL fragment such as `#converse/chat?jid=user@domain`
- #828 Add routing for the `#converse/login` and `#converse/register` URL
  fragments, which will render the registration and login forms respectively.
- New configuration setting [view_mode](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#view-mode)
  This removes the need for separate `inverse.js` and `converse-mobile.js`
  builds. Instead the `converse.js` build is now used with `view_mode` set to
  `fullscreen` and `mobile` respectively.
- Fetch VCard when starting a chat with someone not in the user's roster.
- Show status messages in an MUC room when a user's role changes.
- In MUC chat rooms, collapse multiple, consecutive join/leave messages.
- Performance improvements for rendering private chats, rooms and the contacts roster.
- MUC Leave/Join messages now also show a new day indicator if applicable.

### API changes
- New API method `_converse.disco.supports` to check whether a certain
  service discovery feature is supported by an entity.
- New API method `_converse.api.vcard.get` which fetches the VCard for a
  particular JID.

### Configuration changes
- `hide_open_bookmarks` is now by default `true`.

### UX/UI changes
- #984 Improve loading of archived messages via "infinite scroll"
- Use CSS3 fade transitions to render various elements.
- Remove `Login` and `Registration` tabs and consolidate into one panel.
- Show validation error messages on the login form.
- Don't hang indefinitely and provide nicer error messages when a connection
  can't be established.
- Consolidate error and validation reporting on the registration form.
- Don't close the emojis panel after inserting an emoji.
- Focus the message textarea when the emojis panel is opened or closed.
- MUC chatroom occupants are now sorted alphabetically and according to their roles.

### Technical changes
- Converse.js now includes a [Virtual DOM](https://github.com/snabbdom/snabbdom)
  via [backbone.vdomview](https://github.com/jcbrand/backbone.vdomview) and uses
  it to render various views.
- Converse.js no longer includes all the translations in its build. Instead,
  only the currently relevant translation is requested. This results in a much
  smaller filesize but means that the translations you want to provide need to
  be available. See the [locales_url](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#locales-url)
  configuration setting for more info.
- The translation machinery has now been moved to a separate module in `src/i18n.js`.
- jQuery has been completely removed as a dependency (still used in tests though).

## 3.2.1 (2017-08-29)

### Bugfixes
- Various IE11 fixes.
- #907 Unnecessary login validation error when `default_domain` or `locked_domain` are set.
- #908 Login form for inVerse is only 200px when `allow_registration` is set to `false`.

- #911 Use `getDefaultNickName` consistently to allow better overrides via plugins.
- #912 `maximize` method in `converse-minimize` fails if the `controlbox` is not there.

## 3.2.0 (2017-08-09)

### New Plugins
- New plugin `converse-disco` which replaces the original support for
  [XEP-0030](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0030.html) and which has been
  refactored to allow features for multiple entities to be stored.

### New features and improvements
- Add support for Emojis (either native, or via <a href="https://www.emojione.com/">Emojione</a>).
- Add JID validation to the contact add form, the occupant invite form and the login form.
- #896 Consistently use `XMPP username` in user-facing text (instead of JID, Jabber ID etc.).

### New configuration settings
* The `visible_toolbar_buttons.emoticons` configuration option is now changed to `visible_toolbar_buttons.emoji`.
* [use_emojione](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#use-emojione)
  is used to determine whether Emojione should be used to render emojis,
  otherwise rendering falls back to native browser or OS support.
* [emojione_image_path](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#emojione-image-path)
  is used to specify from where Emojione will load images for rendering emojis.

### New events
* ['discoInitialized'](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/development.html#discoInitialized)
* ['afterMessagesFetched'](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/development.html#afterMessagesFetched)

### Code changes

### New Plugins

  one chat is visible at any given time. Used in the mobile build:
  `converse-mobile.js` and makes the unread messages counter possible there.
  [jcbrand]
- New non-core plugin `converse-roomslist`, which shows a list of open rooms
  in the `Rooms` tab of the control box. [jcbrand]

### New configuration settings
- New setting for `converse-bookmarks`:
  [hide_open_bookmarks](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#hide-open-bookmarks)
  It is meant to be set to `true` when using `converse-roomslist` so that open
  rooms aren't listed twice (in the rooms list and the bookmarks list).

## 0.7.0 (2013-11-13)

### Important:

This release includes support for [Off-the-record encryption](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca).
For this to work, your browser needs a CSPRNG (Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator).

Internet Explorer of all versions doesn't have one at all, neither does older versions of Firefox.

If you need to support older browsers, please download the latest release from the 0.6 bran

#### Features:

- Add a toolbar to the chat boxes [jcbrand]
- Add support for OTR (off-the-record) encryption [jcbrand]
- Add support for smileys [jcbrand]
- Simplified boilerplate markup [jcbrand]
- New configuration settings, `xhr_custom_status_url` and `xhr_user_search_url` [jcbrand]

**note:**
*This release introduces a backward incompatible change. The boilerplate
HTML needed in your webpage for converse.js to work has been reduced to a
single div: `<div id="conversejs"></div>`*
