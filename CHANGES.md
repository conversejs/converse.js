### Breaking changes

- The minimum required NodeJS version for making builds is now 8.9.0
- Rename `muc_disable_moderator_commands` to [muc_disable_slash_commands](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#muc-disable-slash-commands).
- `_converse.api.archive.query` now returns a Promise instead of accepting a callback functions.
- `_converse.api.disco.supports` now returns a Promise which resolves to a Boolean instead of an Array.
- The `forward_messages` config option (which was set to `false` by default) has been removed.
  Use [message_carbons](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#message-carbons) instead.
- Remove the `keepalive` configuration setting. It is now always implicitly `true`.
- Remove the `expose_rid_and_sid` configuration setting.
- A `prebind_url` is now mandatory when setting `authentication` to `prebind`.
  It's no longer possible to pass in `rid` and `sid` values to `converse.initialize.
- Removed events `statusChanged` and `statusMessageChanged`. Instead, you can
  listen on the `change:status` or `change:status\_message` events on
  `_converse.xmppstatus`.
- #1403: Rename show_chatstate_notifications to show_chat_state_notifications

### API changes

- `_converse.chats.open` and `_converse.rooms.open` now take a `force`
  parameter to force maximizing (in `overlayed` view mode) or bringing a
  background chat into the foreground (in `fullscreen` view mode). Previously
  this was the default behavior.
- `_converse.api.emit` has been removed in favor of [\_converse.api.trigger](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/api/-_converse.api.html#.trigger)
- `_converse.updateSettings` has been removed in favor of [\_converse.api.settings.update](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/api/-_converse.api.settings.html#.update)
- `_converse.api.roster.get` now returns a promise.
- New API method [\_converse.api.disco.features.get](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/api/-_converse.api.disco.features.html#.get)
- New API method [\_converse.api.connection.reconnect](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/api/-_converse.api.connection.html#.reconnect)

## 4.2.0 (2019-04-04)

**Note:** This release introduces a hard requirement on [MAM:2](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html),
specifically the requirement that the MAM archive ID matches the [XEP-0359 stanza-id](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0359.html).
Patches intended to make Converse work with MAM:1 will cause problems and
unexpected behaviour due to the above requirement, which is not met with MAM:1.
This will affect OpenFire users who use the [monitoring plugin](https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugin-archive.jsp?plugin=monitoring)
version 1.7.0 and below. You're advised to stay on Converse version 4.1.2 until an update to that plugin has been released.

  roster-related data. Previously this code was in `converse-core.js`.

### Bugfixes
- Attribute error when empty IQ stanza is returned for vCard query

  when a new message appears inside it.

### Security fixes

- CVE-2018-6591: Don't allow PEP bookmarks if `pubsub#publish-options` is not advertised by the server.

    In previous versions of converse.js, bookmarks sent to servers that don't
    support `pubsub#publish-options` were visible to all your contacts, even
    though they should be kept private. This is due to those servers simply
    ignoring the `pubsub#publish-options` directive and converse.js not checking
    first whether `pubsub#publish-options` is supported before setting bookmarks
    via PEP.

    More info here: https://gultsch.de/converse_bookmarks.html

### New features
- XEP-0382 Spoiler Messages (currently only for private chats)

- #953 MUC "Features" displayed when exiting configuration
- #967 Rooms list doesn't show when the server doesn't support bookmarks
- Don't require `auto_login` to be `true` when using the API to log in.
- Moment locale wasn't being set to the value passed via the `i18n` option.
- In the chat heading, two avatars sometimes get rendered.
- Refetch the roster from the server after reconnection.
  From the perspective of the XMPP server, this is an entirely new login,
  and therefore as per [RFC-6121](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6121#section-2.1.6)
  the roster SHOULD be queried, making the client an "interested resource".
  Otherwise connected contacts might not get your presence updates.
- The way the archive ID of a MAM message is specified, has changed.
  See https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html#archives_id
- Fixed error building DOM toggle_chats.html span.unread-message-count class attribute
- Bugfix. In a MUC the `/help` command didn't render properly.
- The `/voice` MUC command didn't set the right role in order to grant voice again.

### New Features
- Emojis are now sent in unicode instead of short names
- #314 Add support for opening chat rooms with a URL fragment such as `#converse/room?jid=room@domain`
  and private chats with a URL fragment such as `#converse/chat?jid=user@domain`
- #828 Add routing for the `#converse/login` and `#converse/register` URL
  fragments, which will render the registration and login forms respectively.
- New configuration setting [view_mode](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#view-mode)
  This removes the need for separate `inverse.js` and `converse-mobile.js`
  builds. Instead the `converse.js` build is now used with `view_mode` set to
  `fullscreen` and `mobile` respectively.
- Fetch VCard when starting a chat with someone not in the user's roster.
- Show status messages in an MUC room when a user's role changes.
- In MUC chat rooms, collapse multiple, consecutive join/leave messages.
- Performance improvements for rendering private chats, rooms and the contacts roster.
- MUC Leave/Join messages now also show a new day indicator if applicable.

### API changes
- New API method `_converse.disco.supports` to check whether a certain
  service discovery feature is supported by an entity.
- New API method `_converse.api.vcard.get` which fetches the VCard for a
  particular JID.

### Configuration changes
- `hide_open_bookmarks` is now by default `true`.

### UX/UI changes
- #984 Improve loading of archived messages via "infinite scroll"
- Use CSS3 fade transitions to render various elements.
- Remove `Login` and `Registration` tabs and consolidate into one panel.
- Show validation error messages on the login form.
- Don't hang indefinitely and provide nicer error messages when a connection
  can't be established.
- Consolidate error and validation reporting on the registration form.
- Don't close the emojis panel after inserting an emoji.
- Focus the message textarea when the emojis panel is opened or closed.
- MUC chatroom occupants are now sorted alphabetically and according to their roles.

### Technical changes
- Converse.js now includes a [Virtual DOM](https://github.com/snabbdom/snabbdom)
  via [backbone.vdomview](https://github.com/jcbrand/backbone.vdomview) and uses
  it to render various views.
- Converse.js no longer includes all the translations in its build. Instead,
  only the currently relevant translation is requested. This results in a much
  smaller filesize but means that the translations you want to provide need to
  be available. See the [locales_url](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#locales-url)
  configuration setting for more info.
- The translation machinery has now been moved to a separate module in `src/i18n.js`.
- jQuery has been completely removed as a dependency (still used in tests though).

- #907 Unnecessary login validation error when `default_domain` or `locked_domain` are set.

- #912 `maximize` method in `converse-minimize` fails if the `controlbox` is not there.

## 3.2.0 (2017-08-09)

### New Plugins

  [XEP-0030](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0030.html) and which has been
  refactored to allow features for multiple entities to be stored.

### New features and improvements
- Add support for Emojis (either native, or via <a href="https://www.emojione.com/">Emojione</a>).
- Add JID validation to the contact add form, the occupant invite form and the login form.
- #896 Consistently use `XMPP username` in user-facing text (instead of JID, Jabber ID etc.).

### New configuration settings
* The `visible_toolbar_buttons.emoticons` configuration option is now changed to `visible_toolbar_buttons.emoji`.
* [use_emojione](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#use-emojione)
  is used to determine whether Emojione should be used to render emojis,
  otherwise rendering falls back to native browser or OS support.
* [emojione_image_path](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#emojione-image-path)
  is used to specify from where Emojione will load images for rendering emojis.

### New events
* ['discoInitialized'](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/development.html#discoInitialized)
* ['afterMessagesFetched'](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/development.html#afterMessagesFetched)

### New Plugins
- New non-core plugin `converse-singleton` which ensures that no more than
  one chat is visible at any given time. Used in the mobile build:
  `converse-mobile.js` and makes the unread messages counter possible there.
  [jcbrand]
- New non-core plugin `converse-roomslist`, which shows a list of open rooms
  in the `Rooms` tab of the control box. [jcbrand]

### New configuration settings
- New setting for `converse-bookmarks`:
  [hide_open_bookmarks](https://conversejs.org/docs/html/configuration.html#hide-open-bookmarks)
  It is meant to be set to `true` when using `converse-roomslist` so that open
  rooms aren't listed twice (in the rooms list and the bookmarks list).
