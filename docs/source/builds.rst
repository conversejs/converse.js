.. warning:: There current documentation in this section does not adequately
    explain how to create custom builds.

.. note:: Please make sure to read the section :doc:`development` and that you have installed
    all development dependencies (long story short, you should be able to just run  ``make dev``)

Creating builds and distribution files
======================================

Converse.js uses `AMD (Asynchronous Modules Definition) <http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html#amd>`_
to define modules and their dependencies.

Dependencies can then be loaded on-the-fly with `require.js <http://requirejs.org>`_.
This is very useful during development, but when it comes to
deployement you'll usually want to create a single, minified distribution build.

For this, the `r.js optimizer <http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html>`_
is used together with `almond.js <https://github.com/requirejs/almond>`_, which
is a smaller and minimal AMD API implementation that replaces require.js in builds.

To create the distribution builds, simply run::

    make dist

This command does the following:

* It creates different builds of Converse.js in the ``./dist/`` directory.

* It bundles all the translation files in ``./locale/`` into a single file ``locales.js``.
  This file can then be included via the ``<script>`` tag. See for example the ``non_amd.html`` example page.

* Also, the CSS files in the ``./css`` directory will be minified.

The JavaScript build files are contained in the ``./dist`` directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    jc@conversejs:~/converse.js (master)$ ls dist/
    converse-mobile.js               converse.min.js
    converse-mobile.min.js           converse.nojquery.js
    converse-no-dependencies.js      converse.nojquery.min.js
    converse-no-dependencies.min.js  locales.js
    converse.js

.. _`minification`:

Creating custom builds
----------------------

One reason you might want to create your own builds, is because you want to
remove some of the core plugins of converse.js, or perhaps you want to include
your own.

To add or remove plugins from the build, you need to modify the
``src/converse.js`` file.

You'll find a section marked ``/* START: Removable components`` and
``/* END: Removable components */``.

In this section is listed all the converse.js plugins that will make up a
build.

You could for example decide to disable the ControlBox altogether by removing
the ``converse-controlbox`` plugin.

After doing so, you need to run ``make dist`` again in the root or your
converse.js repository, in order to generate the new build.

Be aware that some plugins might have dependencies on other plugins, so if you
remove a certain plugin but other included plugins still depend on it, then it
will still be included in your build.

To see which other plugins a particular plugin depends on, open it up in your
text editor and look at the list specified as the second parameter to the
``define`` call, near the top of the file. This list specifies the dependencies
of that plugin.

Minifying the CSS
-----------------

To only minify the CSS files, nothing else, run the following command::

    make cssmin

The CSS files  are minified via `cssmin <https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-cssmin>`_.
