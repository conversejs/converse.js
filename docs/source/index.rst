Preface
=======

This is the official documentation for Converse.js. If you'd like to
contribute, please read the :doc:`documentation` page.

You might instead be looking for the `User Manual <manual.html>`_.

Introduction
============

Converse.js is a free and open-source `XMPP <http://xmpp.org/about-xmpp/>`_
chat client written in Javascript which can be tightly integrated into any website.

The benefit of using converse.js as opposed to relying on a SaaS
(software-as-a-service) solution, is that your users can have a much more
customized, streamlined and integrated webchat experience and that you have
control over the data. The latter being a requirement for many sites dealing
with sensitive information.

You'll likely want users who are authenticated on your website, to also
automatically be authenticated on the XMPP server. In order to do this, you'll
have to add some server-side code for your website.

The :ref:`what-you-will-need` and :ref:`session-support` sections provide more information on how to achieve this.
