## Introduction

Converse is a free and open-source [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/about-xmpp/) chat client written in JavaScript which can be tightly integrated into any website.

The benefit of using Converse as opposed to relying on a SaaS (software-as-a-service) solution, is that your users can have a much more customized, streamlined and integrated webchat experience and that you have control over the data. The latter being a requirement for many sites dealing with sensitive information.

You'll likely want users who are authenticated on your website to also automatically be authenticated on the XMPP server. In order to do this, you'll have to add some server-side code for your website.

The [Setup and Integration](/setup/#an-xmpp-server) and [Session Management](/session/) sections provide more information on how to achieve this.
