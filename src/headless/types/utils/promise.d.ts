 * Creates a {@link Promise} that resolves if the passed in function returns a truthy value.

 * @param { Function } func - The function called every check_delay,

 * @param { number } [max_wait=300] - The time to wait before rejecting the promise.
 * @param { number } [check_delay=3] - The time to wait before each invocation of {func}.
 * @returns {Promise} A promise resolved with the value of func,
 *  or rejected with the exception thrown by it or it times out.
